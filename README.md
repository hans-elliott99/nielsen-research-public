# Public research code

I have written a lot of code to access and analyze various data sources, some private and some public.  
Here I will publish some of the code which I am able to share, as it may be a useful blueprint for others.

## About the project:  
The core dataset used in our research is the "Nielsen and NielsenIQ Marketing Data", which can be read about here: https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/datasets/nielsenIQ-nielsen  
This is a private dataset and related information/code cannot be shared. Some scripts will rely on this proprietary data.
